  abstract =      {Ponzi schemes are financial frauds which lure users
                   under the promise of high profits. Actually, users
                   are repaid only with the investments of new users
                   joining the scheme: consequently, a Ponzi scheme
                   implodes soon after users stop joining it. Originated
                   in the offline world 150 years ago, Ponzi schemes
                   have since then migrated to the digital world,
                   approaching first the Web, and more recently hanging
                   over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contract
                   platforms like Ethereum have provided a new
                   opportunity for scammers, who have now the
                   possibility of creating ``trustworthy'' frauds that
                   still make users lose money, but at least are
                   guaranteed to execute ``correctly''. We present a
                   comprehensive survey of Ponzi schemes on Ethereum,
                   analysing their behaviour and their impact from
                   various viewpoints.},
