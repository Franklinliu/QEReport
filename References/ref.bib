@article{Perez2019,
	Abstract = {In the last year we have seen a great deal of both academic and practical interest in the topic of vulnerabilities in smart contracts, particularly those developed for the Ethereum blockchain. In this paper we survey the 21,270 vulnerable contracts reported by six recent academic projects. Contrary to what might have been believed given the reported number of vulnerable contracts, there has been precious little in terms of actual exploitation when it comes to these vulnerabilities. We find that at most 504 out of 21,270 contracts have been subjected to exploits. This corresponds to at most 9,066 ETH ({\~}1.8 million USD), or only 0.29{\%} of the 3 million ETH (600 million USD) claimed in some of the papers. While we are certainly not implying that smart contract vulnerability research is without merit, our results suggest that the potential impact of vulnerable code had been greatly exaggerated.},

@article{BARTOLETTI2020259,
	Abstract = {Ponzi schemes are financial frauds which lure users under the promise of high profits. Actually, users are repaid only with the investments of new users joining the scheme: consequently, a Ponzi scheme implodes soon after users stop joining it. Originated in the offline world 150 years ago, Ponzi schemes have since then migrated to the digital world, approaching first the Web, and more recently hanging over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum have provided a new opportunity for scammers, who have now the possibility of creating ``trustworthy'' frauds that still make users lose money, but at least are guaranteed to execute ``correctly''. We present a comprehensive survey of Ponzi schemes on Ethereum, analysing their behaviour and their impact from various viewpoints.},
