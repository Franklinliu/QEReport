This report compiles the published works that I have done on model based testing of smart contracts, automatic fairness verification of smart contracts.
The promising results of these works provide strong support for the efficiency and capability of model-based testing compared to existing testing methods 
and for the importance of fairness problem related to smart contracts, which usually deviates from the expectation of novice contract users respectively.
The future work on finding permission bugs via time travel on transaction history of smart contracts has also been briefly illustrated and will be finished in the near future.
Meanwhile, a big picture of the framework to enforce both security and fairness of smart contracts remains a quite challenge which I will also explore further.
